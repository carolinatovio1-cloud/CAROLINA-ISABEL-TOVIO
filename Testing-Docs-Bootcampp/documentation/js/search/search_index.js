generation.\n\n## Contents\n\n- **Templates** (\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

desarrollado con NestJS bajo una arquitectura modular y orientada a controladores, servicios y guards.El objetivo principal es implementar endpoints funcionales, pruebas (testing) y documentación técnica automatizada.\n\nStack del proyecto\n\nFramework: NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript)\nBase de datos: MySQL / PostgreSQL (según configuración del .env)\nORM: TypeORM\nLenguaje: TypeScript\nTesting: Jest\nDocumentación: Compodoc\nGestor de dependencias: npm o yarn\n\n\nInstalación del proyecto\n\nClonar el repositorio:\nExample :git clone https://github.com/carolinatovio1-cloud/CAROLINA-ISABEL-TOVIO.git\ncd taller3\nInstalar las dependencias:\nnpm install\n\nCrear el archivo de entorno en la raíz del proyecto con las variables necesarias:\n   type: 'postgres',\n   autoLoadEntities: true,\n   synchronize: true,\n   port: 5432,\n   username: 'postgres',\n   password: '****',\n   host: 'localhost',\n   database: 'social-media',\n\n\n\nEjecución del proyecto\n\nModo desarrollo:\nnpm run start:dev\n\nModo producción:\nnpm run start:prod\n\nVerificar el servidor activo en:\nhttp://localhost:3000\n\n\n\nUso del proyecto\nEl proyecto contiene módulos organizados por entidades.\nCada módulo incluye:\n\nController → Define las rutas (endpoints)\nService → Contiene la lógica del negocio\nEntity → Mapea las tablas de la base de datos\nDTOs → Validan y tipan los datos de entrada\nGuards → Protegen las rutas mediante autenticación/autorización\n\nEjemplo de endpoints básicos (según entidad):\nGET    /api/entidad        # Listar todos\nGET    /api/entidad/:id    # Obtener uno\nPOST   /api/entidad        # Crear nuevo\nPUT    /api/entidad/:id    # Actualizar\nDELETE /api/entidad/:id    # Eliminar\n\nDocumentación de rutas (Swagger)\nLa documentación de las rutas se generó automáticamente con Swagger, usando los decoradores de NestJS como @ApiTags, @ApiOperation, @ApiResponse y @ApiBody.\nCómo visualizar la documentación Swagger\n\nInicia el servidor con: npm run start:dev\nAbre en tu navegador: http://localhost:3000/api/docs\n\nAllí encontrarás todos los endpoints documentados con su descripción, parámetros y ejemplos de request/response.\nEjemplo de endpoint documentado:\n@ApiTags('usuario')\n@Controller('usuario')\nexport class UsuarioController {\n  @Post('register')\n  @ApiOperation({ summary: 'Registrar un nuevo usuario' })\n  @ApiResponse({ status: 201, description: 'Usuario creado exitosamente.' })\n  @ApiResponse({ status: 400, description: 'Datos inválidos.' })\n  createUser(@Body() dto: CreateUsuarioDto) {\n    return this.usuarioService.createUser(dto);\n  }\n}\n\nResultado esperado:\nCuando el servidor esté corriendo, Swagger mostrará automáticamente todos los endpoints del módulo usuario (registro, login, listar, actualizar, eliminar) con sus ejemplos y descripciones.\n\n\nTesting\n\nPara ejecutar las pruebas unitarias:\nnpm run test\n\nPara generar el coverage (cobertura de código):\nnpm run test:cov\n\n\nLas pruebas incluyen:\nControllers\nServices / Providers\nGuards\nDocumentación del código (Compodoc)\n\nDocumentación técnica (Compodoc)\nPara generar la documentación técnica completa del proyecto (controladores, servicios, módulos, entidades y dependencias):\nnpx compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s\nLuego, abre en el navegador la URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080\n\nContribución al proyecto\nPara aportar al proyecto:\n\nCrear una rama para tu trabajo:\ngit checkout -b \n\nRealizar tus cambios y commits.\n\nHacer push de la rama:\ngit push origin\n\n\nCrear un Pull Request hacia develop o main.\nRoles\n\nMonica Ismelia Caña Reyes – Documentación técnica (CompoDoc)\n\nCarolina Isabel
